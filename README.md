# Application of ML to Pressure Cluster Differentiation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled **ApplicationOfMLToPressureClusterDifferentiation (5).ipynb**. The notebook demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques—specifically clustering methods—to characterize petrophysical properties in reservoirs through pressure data differentiation.

## Overview

Accurate petrophysical property characterization is critical in reservoir management. Traditional methods often struggle with complex and noisy pressure data. In this project, machine learning is applied to differentiate pressure clusters, enabling a more nuanced understanding of reservoir dynamics. Key highlights include:

- **Clustering Techniques**: Utilized unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to identify distinct pressure clusters.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared reservoir pressure data for analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated clustering performance to ensure robust differentiation.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved an impressive level of differentiation accuracy, supporting more informed decision-making in reservoir management.
